			<div class="blog-post blog-element">We know several things about resumes that makes them suck. First of all, they’re paper. That makes them a poor medium for conveying any sort of graphic and an impossible medium for video, code, and really anything dynamic. We ask ourselves, how can we possibly show off our best work if we’re required to take our best experiences and write them down. No story to tell. Just words on paper.<br /><br />Resumes are outdated, literally. The data on the paper is already surpassed by what you have done since filing it away in your desk, sending it to a company, or saving it to a “Resume” folder on your computer. Your experience and knowledge is organic, growing and changing as life happens. Shouldn’t the medium you choose to describe your experiences be as dynamic as you are?<br /><br />Make sure you update your Vestn profile just as you update your knowledge and you’ll not only be able to better demonstrate yourselves to employers, but you’ll also be able to benefit from the social networking capabilities of Vestn.</div>
